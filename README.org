Implement many AUCTeX key bindings for Org mode documents, by giving them an
"Org equivalent" or Org-like effect.

** Download

Get the full Git repository at
https://github.com/fniessen/org-auctex-key-bindings using the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/fniessen/org-auctex-key-bindings.git
#+END_SRC

** Installation

- Install [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-auctex-key-bindings][org-auctex-key-bindings]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; make sure `org-auctex-key-bindings.el' is in your `load-path'
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-auctex-key-bindings")

  ;; require it as normal
  (require 'org-auctex-keys)
  #+END_SRC

- Restart Emacs.

** Usage

Whenever you want to use AUCTeX key bindings inside your Org document, press
=C-+= or type:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x org-auctex-keys-minor-mode
#+end_src

You should now see =AUCKeys= in the list of minor modes, in your mode line.

Calling the same command another time (via =C-+= or
=M-x org-auctex-keys-minor-mode=) will disable the =AUCKeys= minor mode.

To get it automatically turned on in every Org buffer, add this in your Emacs
configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-auctex-keys-minor-mode)
#+end_src

** AUCTeX keyboard shortcuts

Save time and boost your productivity in Org documents with AUCTeX keyboard
shortcuts.

*** Enabled AUCTeX shortcuts for Org mode

Currently implemented:

| Shortcut    | What it runs                       |
|-------------+------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-s=     | =org-insert-heading=                 |
| =C-c C-j=     | =org-insert-heading-respect-content= |
| =C-c C-f C-e= | =org-auckeys-font= (emphasize)       |
| =C-c C-f C-b= | =org-auckeys-font= (bold)            |
| =C-c C-f C-t= | =org-auckeys-font= (typewriter)      |
| =C-c C-f C-i= | =org-auckeys-font= (italic)          |
| =C-c C-e=     | =org-auckeys-environment=            |
| =C-c C-c=     | =org-export-dispatch=                |

As I'm not a heavy user of AUCTeX, I don't know which other AUCTeX keys are
important to be offered by this minor mode. Please tell me!

*** Disabled Org mode shortcuts

As there are conflicts between AUCTeX and Org key bindings, whenever this minor
mode is enabled, you'll temporarily loose the standard behavior of:

| Shortcut | What it ran                    |
|----------+--------------------------------|
| =C-c C-s=  | =org-schedule=                   |
| =C-c C-j=  | =org-goto=                       |
| =C-c C-f=  | =org-forward-heading-same-level= |
| =C-c C-e=  | =org-export-dispatch=            |
| =C-c C-c=  | =org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c=              |
